document.querySelector('p').textContent=' I have learned a lot of things about HTML, CSS, and Javascript in recent days. In HTML a lot of things such as tags, attributes, different types of heading order, unordered lists, images, paragraphs, and many more. I have also learned how to add external CSS and javascript files with HTML. Know about inline and block elements, uses of classes, and tags on different occasionsIn CSS I have learned how to perform a good design. I have shown how internal CSS, inline CSS, and external CSS work. How do add different colors in font how do add padding and margins in styles. Create different layouts, and learn about CSS grids. Also learn about how to make a webpage responsive for small, medium, and large size devices using media query. How to add background color and also background images on the webpage. So these are the things I have learned from CSS.In JavaScript, I have learned a lot of things and this part is always interesting for me. I know about C++ and python before and for that purpose, this session looks very interesting while learning. I have learned how to declare variables by using let, const, and var. The differences between let, var, and const. How to get input from users and convert the value in numbers because JS by default makes it a string. Know about conditional statements, loops, and functions. I solve some problems using these concepts. Perform booleans, arithmetic, and terminate loops using break and perform skip in desired occasions and logical operations in code and finally make a simple calculator project.'
